Q2. Write a prefix stack and show how it works (in main).

WhitePaper:

- So my prefix stack contains two functions i.e op() and evaluatePrefix().
- op(): It is a bool function which takes a character and returns true if the character is decimal.

- evaluatePrefix(): A function which takes in a string and returns a double. The function first creates                      a stack. Then it converts each element of the string into a double and pushes into                       the stack. Then we take the top and pop off. We again take the top and pop. We then                     let one element be A and other be B. We then use a switch for different cases. At                     the end, we return a double.

- main() : we convert the prefix and get the solution.
